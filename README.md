This repository contains projects I used to familiarize myself with coding.

Let it be known that everything in this repository was used strictly for learning purposes and (sadly) never generated me any sort of income.

Within each project you'll find a README.md like this one that includes a slight explanation for the project and reference on where I got the inspiration as well as author's attributes for the assets I've used(if any).

I hope you enjoy every bit of this rep and please if possible do not hesitate to give me your honest feedback. You can contact me via email: ashimweevangeliste@gmail.com or any platform you might find in my projects. 

Ciao!!!!
