You'd wonder why I chose to revise this project once again...

Of course you wouldn't.Even if you would, the answer is quite simple
I've just spend nearly a month without even writing '

Courtesy of UR induction(pssh) well not entirely my Pc had a couple of issues(doesn't it always) but this time man Blue screen of death almost knocked me out 
Well if you think about it, it did knock me out cause I literally had to reset my computer(for some reason that's my solution for everything...)
All in all I'm up and running again and as you can imagine weaker than before.

What lesson did I learn from all this you ask?
Well now I'm certain that I need to use Git and GitHub more often cause although they're the ones that came to the rescue with a small portion of my projects I should've committed more(hi hi hi)

Anyways,this project revision was all about testing how far I fell and mama yake boy can code basi.

As we all know by now, I'm not so good at footers(hihihi) so yeah see you in the next README(And yes I did not say projects cause it's so exhaustingggg to write these bambe but they're really fun thoo)

Ciaoo!!!
